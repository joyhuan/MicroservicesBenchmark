# EnrollmentApp

## Caveats
- Notice app/professor is currently not in use cause professor-card and roster-professor are put inside roster. This is not clean cause the modules are mixed together but it makes network routing slightly easier (though not much easier but it's friendly enought for beginners like me). If given more time in the future, will migrate professor-card and roster-professor under professor folder.
