James Shealy,3.5,100%,4.2,Lots of homework; EXTRA CREDIT; Clear grading criteria; Hilarious; Caring; Respected; Lecture heavy,"[['5.00', 'Aaron Wagner', 'https://www.ratemyprofessors.com//ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1658929'], ['5.00', 'Alice Mercier', 'https://www.ratemyprofessors.com//ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2496619'], ['5.00', 'Amy Williams', 'https://www.ratemyprofessors.com//ShowRatings.jsp?tid=2435205']]","3150 is one of the hardest ECE courses at Cornell, and there is a lot to get through. Shealy has to go fast, but he really cares that we learn from him and understand the material. The homework and labs are tough and time-consuming but they reinforce the material really well and solidify our analog circuit skills. In OH Shealy is super helpful too.; Honestly a great professor. Teaches the Intro Circuits class very well, doesn't waste time during lectures. Can tell he really cares about ensuring that you're getting your money's worth from the lectures, so they end up being quite dense and fast paced. Has hilarious comments he'll make during class. 2100 is hard b/c of material, not b/c of him.; Lecture's are pretty standard, a bit fast paced at first, but settles down as the semester progresses. Problem sets are biweekly, but very long. Labs also take a very long time and are often confusing. Exams are very easy; he gives you very explicit hints to the content of the exams before hand since 2100 covers so much material.; He's a nice guy and is always willing to help you out. That said, lectures are hopelessly fast paced, he treats corequisites as prerequisites, and blows through a 2-3 semester texbook in one.; An extremely challenging professor. Lectures left me lost and confused every time with difficult exams. Homework and lab reports took forever. Some labs were interesting, but the class was a nightmare overall.; Shealy is ridiculously smart. Definitely a genius.; Shealy is the MAN. He teaches you how to think like an engineer. His tests are a bit tough but if you have the intuition they're easy. I just wish he'd teach every ECE class because that would be sick; The course, the book and Shealy's teaching attitude/ability left me with a feeling that a large part of my tuition money has been spent by Dick Shealy on pregaming before the lectures. The guy is smart, but makes no effort to teach the class. The amount of information this course covers is ridiculous. Labs and homeworks are devices for torture!; Definitly a genious. Funny. Has pride in GaAs, but from what I hear, it sucks!~ Always complained that the prof of the class before him wrote too high~! Says he was in a frat; Totally disastrous class. You definitely have to read the textbook to keep up with him. His exams are killer - the only way to survive is to make a super comprehensive ""cheatsheet"" to bring into exam, and just copy every crap on ur cheatsheet onto the exam.; Bad temper. Has half a bottle of whiskey on him before going to lab. Makes exams insanely hard. Is a freaking genius. Willing to help, as long as he is in a good mood. But a nice guy none the less.; This class is probably a hard class itself, and it's not Shealy's fault.  A lot of notes to copy,and material is covered very quickly, probably because Shealy expects everyone to be as smart as him.  But I have to say, he IS a very smart prof. An intellectually stimulating course.; He doesn't know how to calculate standard deviation of an exam =P there's no way that the SD of a prelim is 44.; It is true that ECE 315 is among the hardest course in ECE department..and you will hate shealy after the first prelim. But if you ask for help (be sure to say no if you don't understand), shealy is extremely helpful. after taking the course, you will learn a lot and realize shealy is a great prof; Knows his stuff but is really hardcore.  He always made me laugh so that made a hard class a little easier in lecture.  Don't blame Shealy, 315 is a hard hard class.  Plus I drank with him one night at the 9s.  Classic.; Horrible class! He goes through the material at break-neck speed and then blames US for not knowing the material well! He thinks every one of us majors in ECE 315 but he's sadly mistaken. This stinking class is yet another of Cornell's bad core classes.; He makes jokes that are not funny, because he thinks they are funny.Besides, he smells like alcohol( whiskey, to be precise). He assumes that we know everything and he doesn`t care whether we actually know the material.; I love this man...soo damn cool even though he was always late to class, he helped me a great deal; No Comments; No Comments",20

Although some of the reports are rough, you can always seek help at his office hours or his great TAs. I extremely recommend that ECEs take ECE2400 instead of CS 2110.; One of the best professors in the Engineering department, if not Cornell. If you pay attention in class, you will do well for sure. Only hard part was the long lab reports we had to write.; His lecture is great and you do need to put effort to study; Great professor who really goes in depth to make sure you understand each topic he teaches. He's always accessible outside of class and gives helpful feedback on exams/homework assignments. Pretty tough grader and assignments are challenging, but you'll learn so much from this class.; best professor of all time; Batten is simply one of the best professors at Cornell. He is well prepared before every lecture and explains concepts very well. Video-notes are still very helpful. Homework is  long and difficult but you can learn a lot. Project can be challenging, but Batten will help you find your bug. He is as dedicated a professor as they come.; One of the best professors I have ever had (I am a Master's student whose undergraduate institution is not Cornell). He is funny, he knows his stuff really well. He is extremely willing to help students learn. He explains concepts remarkably well. Very enjoyable class. He is tough on grading though.; He is an awesome Professor. He helps us in learning every concept by giving a real-time analogy. All his assignments help us in strengthening our knowledge in all of the important concepts. He makes us approach every problem from a different perspective. We are confidently able to talk about design trade-offs after attending this course.; Hands down one of the best professors in the ECE dept. Class is challenging but the effort from the prof to help out, in class, in his office or on the online forums makes you an expert in his subject. Explanations and notes are clear and always encourages constructive discussions! Labs are hard and do require time, but you'll be proud of the work!",9

A very intelligent professor who knows his stuff. His lectures are math-focused and he covers a lot of materials, and he gives a quiz every lecture (but they are pretty easy). But no prelims so what you get out of the course is entirely dependent on your own interests and initiatives.",1

Take his class if you are on the edge; This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.; Park Doing does not structure his lectures well. It seems as though the models he uses to analyze robot ethics are made up by him. I have a feeling that he sees this class as a break from his research and so the students suffer. Grading is not clear at all. Gives a prompt for an assignment then shows the criteria for grading AFTER students submit.; Doing has no structure to his class and spends all the time holding the vaguest possible discussions. No substance is learned, the most common sources for this class are pop-science videos (which includes RT America, a Russian propaganda source). Wrote a paper where the sources were a paper from 1992 and a Quora forum. DO NOT take this class; so unclear on grading; Professor Doing is the best professor I've been taught by. He is really funny, the lectures and essays are really chilled out on one level, and yet, on another, he's actually teaching us meta-epistemology, without any of the jargon. He really made me think about ethics in a completely different light; I highly recommend him.; Professor Doing is a good guy. Very relaxed and prelims are really easy. He is kind of disorganized and grading isn't very clear. I would overall take this course again though. Not tough.; He's great. This is an awesome beginner course for philosophy. I had to take this class for my environmental science major. the required philosophy class is either in the fall (with someone else) or this one. this one is so much more relaxed. If you really want to get down and dirty with philosophy, choose fall. This one is EZPZ",8

Very knowledgeable, approachable, and willing to accommodate during the online course. I'm not good at e&m but his lectures are so well-structured and designed that everyone can comprehend.; Great professor and the material is really interesting. Also, professor was very accessible and accommodating during online mode of lectures.; Taking this class with Prof. Monticone will ensure you have a deep understanding of e&m while giving a ton of applications. It is a balanced class which can take your knowledge to the level of modern research or give you a basis for deep questions on light-matter interaction. His lectures are so well designed, it is like listening to a great story!; Professor Monticone is a one of a kind teacher, & for anyone interested in learning more about electromagnetism, taking a course with him is a must! Monticone is the only Professor at Cornell (I know of) who is unanimously loved by all students. Most important course I took! He is passionate, knowledgeable, and delivers exciting lectures every time; Both of Profesor Monticone's classes are very good. He is a very good teacher who puts a lot of effort into his lectures. He covers what's at the forefront of the field, but he makes it accessible. He is very fair in his grading.; Professor Monticone is a really nice professor who take good care of his students. He is also very professional in his area which makes us learn a lot.; This class was a great introduction to metamaterials. Prof Monticone's lectures are well-paced and gives you both the fundamentals and exposure to some cutting-edge work in the field. 3 psets + 2 prelims and a final which are fairly straightforward. Also Prof Monticone is easygoing, approachable and really helpful if you go to his OH or email him!; Really great lecture! Although the content of the lecture was somewhat difficult, Prof. Monticone did his best to convey it clearly. Recommended to anyone who is interested in advanced electromagnetics.; Course is enjoyable and educating. Prof. Monticone excels at summarizing a complex body of electrodynamics theory into a clear, coherent lecture. Course material covers cutting-edge research, but is thorough in its theoretical foundation to allow the student to perform own analysis. Optional reading will give the student strong grasp on material.; An amazing course with advanced topics, which were very effectively conveyed by Prof. Monticone. I had an amazing experience in the class, and would recommend it without any hesitation.; Professor Monticone has a knack for taking complicated subjects and synthesizing clear explanations for them that do not involve complicated math. This is the second class I have taken with him and it has been a pleasure to attend his lectures; A very good course. Course materials cover from fundamental concepts and theorems of electrodynamics to frontier research topics of complex electromagnetic media and nanophotonics.; very knowledgeable in his field, good at answering questions, very friendly, gives relatively few homeworks; Prof. Monticone clearly explained the fundamentals behind novel photonic phenomenon. As a graduate student doing research in this field, I find that all the materials discussed in this class very helpful. Prof. Monticone is very knowledgeable and nice. I always enjoy the in-depth research discussions with him.; Well, his classes so far covered very specific topics--mostly related to his research interests--but he did an excellent job to engage students into those topics very naturally. He is really solid in organizing and pacing the class--not too fast and not too slow. It was great that he connects the class materials to classic or frontier researches.; The class was ideal for covering modern electromagnetism topics, and was the exact extension I needed to fill up the gap between fundamentals and application. Prof. Monticone is a great lecturer and is very knowledgeable about the subject. His notes have been very helpful, and I understand a lot more about the subject.; As a graduate student specializing in the field of metamaterials this class was a great at filling up different gaps that I had in my knowledge of the subject. Professor Monticone did a terrific job at simplifying complicated concepts with concise examples. His choice of subjects for the class was on point.; I enjoyed ECE4960 thoroughly. The course material is very interesting and of major present research interest. Francesco is very patient and helpful during office hours. The course material is intrinsically quite challenging, but I think Francesco did a good job of selecting homework and exam problems of appropriate difficulty.; Professor Monticone is a great professor. He has high standards but is also encouraging. He was really invested in whether or not I understand the material during office hours, and he's one of the best professors I've hard at Cornell from a social perspective. The material was complex, but it was doable with Monticone's patient and consistent help.; ECE 4960 is one of the best courses that I have taken at Cornell. This course perfectly connects the theory with the application. Moreover, Prof. Monticore is a very good and easy-going teacher. He explains the math precisely and his lecture notes are very clear and helpful. He always welcomes us to discuss homework problems with him.",20

He is so smart, it's a bit hard to follow his thought process fast enough in person. But he always records his lectures and posts them online. When you watch his lecture for a second time online, it is so mind-opening and it makes everything so explainable! Definitely gonna take his class 3250 next sem!; Amazing lecturer who writes fun, challenging, and useful homeworks. Tests are easy enough that if you understand the course material well, you're very likely to do well.; Snitch, always out there to hurt and back-stab his own students. Do not trust him with any questions he asks or responds to, and always-always record him. He ruined multiple students life and career for his personal interests. Don't take his classes, and if you are wronged by all means then file a complaint against him.; Lectures are confusing, he kept writing every single word he said on the board. Few people can catch up with his notes. Once you lost track of what's going on, the rest of the lecture becomes a waste of time. TAs are not quite helpful.; Delchamps is really a great professor and you should really try to take a class with him (especially 3250), but his organization of 4250 was a bit messy. We had 2 problem sets the whole semester which made it very difficult to learn the material otherwise. Project for the course was a lot of fun.; One of the most caring and kind professors at Cornell. Lectures always designed to reflect the class's level of understanding of the material. Answers emails and Piazza questions very quickly. Exams are challenging, but studying past exams is extremely helpful and will guarantee that you will do well.; Homework and exam require techniques that are not straightforward from what was taught in class. One must have a creativity and strong background in linear algebra.; Great teacher with amazingly thorough understanding of all the material. Always responds to emailsquestions and cares for his students. Also one big plus - homework deadlines were lax; THanks to Professor Delchamps all my other clases for my MEng came so simple. If there is a class I can remember as memorable, this is the one. How could he simply get to the blackboard and deliver his class without notes just blew my mind. When we had questions he answered in a simple way easy to understand. Thanks Prof Delchamps.; I took his class 24 years ago and his course remains the most important engineering course in my career as a surgeon and co-inventor of Rebiscan.  The overall concepts of input / output systems was delivered second to none. It was that beer he bought for me at the Palms and told me to seek advanced degrees that changed my life.; Awesome; Probably the greatest professor I've had at Cornell, highly recommend both him and the course (ENGRI 126) to anyone interested (or not interested, it was that good!) in any kind of electrical engineering or computer science or communications in general.; This is the third semester that I've had Professor Delchamps.  His style is the best I've had at Cornell.  He always gives a lot of examples and he makes the topics very easy to understand - as long as you can keep up in the notetaking and listening (which; Great guy. Class was good too.; Totally awesome teacher.  Had super clear lecture notes and very neat writing on the boards.  Extremely organized.  Overall a great teacher!; the most helpful professor i've ever known. this ECE course that i took from him however was not related in any way to ECE, and seemed to stray a bit from the topic of the course. He likes math.; Class notes extremely organized and puts all the information you need on the black board with super-fast chalk writing, exams based on homework, if you do well on homework you'll do well in the class.; Between the baggy jeans and 18 year old ski bum wannabe look, he's the best engr. professor at cornell.  very helpful, kinda ghetto, very smart, and he signs on AIM to help his students.  brilliant guy.  some bad jokes, some good ones.; Took in SP02 when lab separate. funny guy who tries his best. emphasizes math, NOT concepts. at end of course, knew how to do useless math but knew jack about circuits.  hated it for that reason. but this class made me physics instead of ECE so thx dude.; Too smart, too brilliant, expectiation of students too high...The guy that can manipulate all the 3 boards in Phillips 101 the best!!!",20

Math was never easy for me and he made the material easy to get and actually fun! Great great lectures, he understands the students point of view, answers questions clearly. Thank you!!!; I am taking MAT1910 this semester, online. It's a large class and we have many sections taught by different professors. Prof. Poitras' lecture is by far the best, clear, fun, makes me love math and i didn't really before. Thank you. Teach more classes Prof. Poitras!; Poitras is by far the best professor for 1910. He clearly is very passionate about teaching and explains difficult concepts very simply. Many CoE students in lectures with other professors have started watching Poitras instead. He is clear and concise, while still explaining everything fully. He is kind and caring, as well as very engaging.; I really struggle with calc but Carl is amazing at explaining things, he's always in a good mood, he's always down to help and answer questions. Even the CoE students who aren't in his class watch his lectures. We changed the GroupMe name to Carl Appreciation GC. If you have to take 1910, take it with him!; Awesome awesome awesome. Teach more classes Prof. Poitras! Get to his lecture even if it messes up your schedule.; What a good professor. Cornell needs more instructors like Prof. Poitras. Clear, fun, really talented instructor. The material isn't easy but you leave every lecture having understood the material so well that it makes reviewing my notes and doing the problems a breeze (with some work... lol). Thank you Prof. Poitras! Teach more classes!; Not caring. Did not bother to help us with the labs.; He seems like a nice guy, but he was a terrible professor for this class. He cancelled lectures 5 minutes before they were supposed to happen multiple times, the lecture material he presented had almost no relevance to the project we were working on, and he never seemed to know what was going on; Not the first class I have with Professor Poitras. Cornell needs more like him. He knows his stuff, is available, actually cares about his students. The course is a little heavy, we covered a lot of material, but thats why Im at Cornell. The material is current, the final project great.; Carl is a super nice dude, great lecturer and cares about his students. Go to his office hours as much as possible because they are incredibly helpful!! I wouldn't have passed this course without Carl; As a freshman, I was intimidated joining Cornell. Prof. Poitras is an awesome lecturer: clear classes, easy to follow, inspirational. His office hours are also super helpful and he makes himself available outside office hours too. Compared to my other classes, Cornell professors need to follow his example!; Great professor with good lectures. Very clear and easy to understnand; I really suffered in this class. It was a hard class with too much material and too little class time. His lectures were unclear, the textbook was expensive and little used, but the exam material was more of his own stuff. He was misleading about exam material. Although he took pity gradewise, I really hated this class and it caused immense stress; The course content is very poorly presented. Furthermore, the exams and homework are heavily based on number crunching into long formulas, which do not test for understanding.; Carl is incredible and hillarious! He makes difficult concepts understandable. Reading the textbook sections after lecture will help make everything click even more. Prelims are challenging but manageable. He cares immensely about each person and his office hours are so helpful. The class is not an easy A but if you work hard, you can do very well.; Professor Poitras is great. This was my first semester in ECE at Cornell and with that comes a lot of insecurity and nervousness. He is an awesome teacher, cares about us and our success. He masters this math class and has an amazing ability to make us learn the material which can be hard at times. Thank you thank you!; Carl is a fantastic professor with tons of experience in the subject matter and gives excellent lectures. He made me understand what was tougher easily. I love him. Cornell needs more profs like him. He is very approachable and takes the time to answer my questions. Love him.; One of the top very best in ECE. Why can't other professors teach like that??? He's clear, patient, funny, engaging, totally masters the material. I want to study this field! Thanks Carl!!!; Organizes the class well and always does his best of letting the students know of a myriad of deadlines. Put effort into this class and you will do well, but make sure not to slack.; I love this class. The project is awesome, Prof. Poitras does a great job motivating us and explaining concepts.

However, he makes the class revolve only around grades by always saying ""this can be on the final"" and publicly announcing top scorers on each assignment. Made me less interested in the subject.; Only cares about grades, he's a good lecturer but the constant focus on exams and grading instead of the actual subject ruined my enthusiasm for the subject.; okay so great teacher will give 5.0 for teaching... HOWEVER, it is a tad difficult. Also how could you make the final design night lab wednesday.... This is absolutely ridiculous in terms of timing. Why do so many of the students give him a 5.0 rating when they keep repeating difficult and tough grader? let me be an actual honest reviewer.; One of the best lecturers at Cornell. Clearly puts in a lot of effort into teaching his classes and conveys difficult subject matter lucidly. Homework assignments are difficult and time consuming, but doable, especially with his recitation sections. Exams are some of the hardest I've taken at Cornell (much harder than homework assignments).; Awesome in everything; This was by far the most difficult class I have taken at Cornell. Too much material was covered in a single course. And exams were also tough. But Rana is a super good lecturer, very sharp, clear,  and to the point. Almost scary. The course material was also organized extremely well (better than any book) and  I learnt a lot.; Rana looks mean but he is probs one of the nicest professors around. He made an otherwise difficult subject really lucid and he is super helpful with assignments. If you want a good grade, then the class would be a lot of work. Final was way easier than midterm, and grading was lenient. I recommend taking this class with him, if you can.; For the class that had so much material, Rana was really good at picking out the main points, stressing them, and without sacrificing any rigor.  The class was also structured very well, having good coverage of semiconductor physics and; Great lecturer! But extremely difficult material and even more difficult exams. If he wasn't a fairly generous grader, the median on our midterm would've been in the 30's. Through fairly generous grading, it ended up being in the low 60s.; I was impressed by the quality and clarity of the lectures,  handouts and homeworks. He exceeded my expectations. The course is rigorous and you need a broad background in physics to be able to fully appreciate the content.; This was the best class I have taken at Cornell so far. Rana is out of this world. He is the most eloquent and coherent professor in all of Cornell. Listening to him is like listening to Mozart - not a single word is out of place. Why aren't there more people like him in this world.; He is a terrific teacher, crystal clear, speaks a little too fast, but very hot!; Most awesome engineering professor.

Infact truly speaking, this guys is not only renowned in the academia but also in the industry sector. I thank my stars that I took his course. He makes the concepts quite easy, his exams are also easy and he gives minimum homework. He encourages self learning to maximum extent but at the same time helps when needed; Absolutely one of Cornell ECE's best professors. I highly recommend taking a class with him. He knows his stuff and has a good sense of humor. Not only is he knowledgeable, but he's able to communicate (what a concept).; You can't go wrong with Prof Wicker - his lectures are well-organized and fun (he would tell you the history of many things). He tends to be a bit sloppy on the administrative stuffs (hw, labs, exams), but, hey, we still think he is cool.; Great professor!!!

There is no learning without pain!!!; Super hard but worth it; Amazing lectures, lots of problem sets and labs, but ultimately worth it. He and the TAs put a lot of time into the course to ensure a full understanding of analog circuits. Also really interesting uy to talk to outside of class.; Expect lots of work and a lot of learning! Go to office hours and become friends with him! He puts in a lot of effort.; Despite the overwhelming amount of work we were assigned, most of it was not worth much. It was a very leniently graded class and the professors and TAs spent well more than the required amount of time to ensure a high level of understanding.; Challenging but very dedicated to his course.  Excellent selection of TAs.  Attends every discussion and some labs to help out.; One of the best professors I've ever had. He really cares about his students/teaching, is very understanding, and is always willing to help. However, this was also the hardest class I have taken (prelims were pretty rough, labs and homework sets were long/difficult). This class will teach you to care more about learning than your grade; Professor Molnar is a fantastic guy. He's an absolute genius, super nice, and always willing to help his students. You will learn so much if you take ECE 2100 and try your hardest to understand the material being thrown at you. That being said, do not expect this class to be a breeze. Homework sets take forever and labs are tedious. Come prepared.; Prof. Molnar's 2100 will consume your life with coursework if you let it. Overall, it was very educational and worthwhile. And he's a really nice guy. Many students suspect he has (not so) secret superhuman ECE powers.; Prof. Molnar is many things, easy is not one of them. His problem sets/labs are positively sadistic, but he holds himself to the same high standards he holds you to. He is incredibly dedicated (teaches his own discussions, writes own labs) and is super-helpful when you talk to him in person. Overall, a great guy/teacher who will teach you  a ton.; A nice and interesting guy. Seems to care about his students and is willing to help them when they ask for help.

Places a solid foundation for architecture and piques my interest to learn more.; Really enjoyed this class. It fell in the middle of the pandemic, but Christina was supportive and reachable outside class, and always helped us with the project. Would love to take another class she teaches!; I took this class in Spring'20, and half of it was online because of the campus shutdown.

Prof. Delimitriou is an awesome lecturer with deep understanding of the material. The lectures are very engaging! Recommended!; 4750 is the hardest and most awesome course I've taken in my four years at Cornell. The labs are in groups, but still are a lot of work; honestly though, when your processor works it's super rewarding! Prof. is really on top of the material, and although some deadlines were changed, she made the class a lot of fun! Highly recommended!; This was a super interesting course! We go through the cloud system stack from hardware accelerators to cluster management, and new types of apps like microservices and serverless. You also do a semester-long project with 2-3 students and present it in the end. The lectures were really fun & Christina gives very good feedback on the projects!; ECE4750 was the best class I've taken at Cornell! Hands down made me switch from a CS to an ECE major! Christina is a wonderful lecturer, super knowledgeable about computer architecture, and really cares about the students learning! The class is a lot of work, especially the group projects, but it's 100% worth it! Would take again!; This is an awesome class on cloud computing! Wish I had taken this when I first started my PhD! You'll need to read *a lot* of papers but the topics are very interesting and the paper presentations help you get better at reading/understanding papers. Christina is really helpful in guiding you in the research projects!; Super interesting class! Lectures are fun and engaging although some of the in-class quizzes are unnecessarily long for the amount of time given. Nonetheless they help a lot with learning the material and make the prelim and final much easier. Prof. Christina was very helpful, in class and in OH! TAs were great as well! Highly recommended!; The class material is not only fascinating, but very applicable to many rising fields of research. Prof. Delimitrou's lectures present all the most fundamental topics in a very accessible and easy-to-understand format. The labs are a lot of work but super rewarding!

Challenging homework and exam problems (but not tedious!).  The complete opposite of ECE 315.; Lal's a ****! He's da man!; completely different person from 315. 432 is clear and organized. He's extremely helpful with his office hours. Very friendly too.; Soo lost in this class...dunno why I'm still in it; No Comments; WHat abad professor...so unorganized. Don't take 315 with him. He'll make you want to drop ECE. We should have more profs like delchamps and less ones like Lal.; I can't wait until this class is over.  Absolutely awful.; this guy cannot teach at all.  his lectures are just bits and pieces of the lecture notes posted by the book authors, his explanations suck, he's a sneaky ****, pushing back our test past the drop date so we can't dropwhen we all fail the test; okay... no one understands his lectures.  no one in the class knows how to do the hw.  he's missed more lectures than all of my other professors combined.  i'm missing other things but just thinking about this gives me a headache!; He actually admitted in class that he forgets that we take more than 1 class!!! The guy shows up 30 mins late and expects us to stay 30 mins after. The guy is very smart but.... Final project took around 100 hours for most ppl.",15
Lang Tong,2,3.7,N/A,Get ready to read; Lecture heavy; So many papers; Skip class?

I didn't understand why he taught subjects in the order he did confusing. He was awful at lecturing and condescending towards undergraduate students. He had a very poor grasp of what sophomore-level ECEs should already know or what they haven't learned it. I could barely sit through each lecture.; Lecture notes are helpful. HWs were Q's off the text, though I wish he put his own questions. Exams were unstable in difficulty. He's not bad though and he's funny sometimes. He means well too, because he wants to consider our feedback on the course to hopefully run it in a more stable manner. This was his first time teaching 2200 I think.; His class is very dull and the test averages can range anywhere from 55 to 85. The labs are extremely time consuming and are not worth that much. I wouldn't take it again unless it was required.; Lectures do not relate homework at the time it is due.  Definitely not an exciting class.  Held early in the morning with over half of people either absent or asleep.  Lots of Matlab use.  Helpful at strengthening programming and math skills.",5
Peter Doerschuk,2.7,45%,3.5,Amazing lectures; Accessible outside class; Respected; Graded by few things; Hilarious; Skip class? You won't pass.; Caring; Inspirational; Test heavy; Tough grader,"[['5.00', 'Aaron Wagner', 'https://www.ratemyprofessors.com//ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1658929'], ['5.00', 'Christopher Batten', 'https://www.ratemyprofessors.com//ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1908365'], ['5.00', 'David Williamson', 'https://www.ratemyprofessors.com//ShowRatings.jsp?tid=743632']]","Not quite sure what class the previous student went to because his class is extremely disorganized. Piazza questions mainly left unanswered. The 3rd prelim was not graded till a week after the final. No regrades for either exam but they were ""available for pickup in his office"" days after the last day of finals when most students had already left.; Contrary to many reviews, Doerschuk's class was organized. A very caring professor who spent times outside of class to go over HW. His prelims are definitely fair when you study for them. He held review session, which I recommend.; HILARIOUS; I want to preface this by saying that Peter Doerschuk is not a bad guy. That being said, he is the most disorganized man I have met in my life. No syllabus on the first day, no exam stats when handing back tests, posting exam review after the exam, not showing up to his own review session. Come to lecture only if you want to make fun of his voice.; Super funny during lecture. Lectures are disorganized but the textbook and his typed notes make it pretty clear. He always gives out what will be on the exam so study those HW problems specifically or you'll fail. He also gives answers to the hw at the help sessions so go to them. Although I loved doerschuk, I don't think I learned much.; This mans is chaotic good. Super unorganized and sort of just unaware of what goes on outside his world, eg university policies and such, but really just trying to do good by his students. He's really explicit about what kinds of problems will be on exams, so just gotta know those and you're fine!; Very easy professor to learn from. He clearly writes down all the concepts during lectures as well as gives you very helpful hints for exam problems. Always has a review session before homework due dates and exams. Plus, he's really funny and likes to have fun while teaching.; Super funny lectures and pretty clear lectures, but there is a good amount of disorganization. Disorganization doesn't detract from the course too much.  Fair exams, with very specific hints to content on them. Really got me interested in signals in the first place.; Negative stigma about him is over hyped. I've had many professors who were harder to follow along during lecture. He really does care about students and wants everyone to succeed. He is also hilarious. However, the course's administration is disorganized. He gives extra help sessions every week. He drops one prelim grade.; Professor Doerschuk is extraordinarily enthusiastic and a nice guy. That being said, he has made an art form of disorganization. If you like things being on time and proceeding in a logical fashion, it will drive you insane. Tests: go to his review sessions if at all possible or talk to someone who was there; makes studying easier and more focused; Professor Doerschuk was... interesting. He's a really nice guy and seemed like he really wanted to help his students, answering any questions. Had review sessions before each exam and the night before each pset was due. He just was bad in lecture, where material was confusing, he went out of order from book. Final grades were lower than expected; This is definitely my worst teacher ever at Cornell. Makes such an easy course unnecessarily hard, assumes a lot when he explains, doesn't have a syllabus, jumps back and forth in the textbook, gives a lot of exam matching questions not related to the lecture and I can continue ranting on and on. But take signals with this man at your ow risk.; He tries to act cool but doesnt understand subject. Long winded explanations spends too much time on minor details and misses the point. Exams are same style.; Please don't take any class with this professor. He doesn't comes prepared for his lectures...makes the course a joke..his special ability is to present easy things in extremely difficult and incomplete way.His examz never focus on the true content of the class. His questions are full of ambiguity. I lost all my interest for the subject boz of him.",14

Honestly the most time-consuming course I've ever taken but also the most rewarding and practical, in terms of honing your scientific writing skills.; Neurophysiology lab was possibly the most enjoyable course of my Cornell experience. Bruce is a great prof, extremely helpful and supportive, and very knowledgeable. The lab is exciting, though time consuming, and ultimately very rewarding. You also get to practice your scientific writing at a higher level than  any other course you'll take.; lotsa work, easy grading, great teacher, fun guy.; No Comments; Overall great teacher.  Extremely personable and willing to help.  This class was great for anyone to gain electrophysiological techniques and Bruce was awesome in helping you out whenever you needed it.",5
